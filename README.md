A basic space-shooter arcade game, created in Godot.

## Implementation

The explosion spritesheet was released into the public domain by [StumpyStrust](https://opengameart.org/content/explosion-sheet)

The Hyperspace typeface was developed by [Pixel Sagas](https://www.dafont.com/hyperspace.font) and is freely available for personal use.

## Future Development
I wanted to add a way so it scrolls vertically like old space shooter arcade games. I also want to add more enemies for the player to shoot.
